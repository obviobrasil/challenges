# Frontend Engineer Challenge #


### Problem ###

We would like to discover the tastes of people on these subjects, choose at least two:

  - Star wars data: https://swapi.co/documentation
  - Brewdog Beers: https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2
  - Music artists: https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/
  - Marvel comics: https://developer.marvel.com/docs

Can you develop a website where the selected subjects are listed on different URLs and we can filter then by some attributes? If we could give a "like" and see all our likes in a different URL would be awesome.

### Recommendations ###
